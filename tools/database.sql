It\'s Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\". \"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I\'d prefer Hell\" says the politician. \"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.||The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise.

After paying $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya\' got there, Sonny?\"||The young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\"||\"Wheeewee... that\'s a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\"||\"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the banker proudly.||The moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\"||\"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That\'s a pretty nice car, all right... but I\'ll stick with my moped!\"||Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!||\"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it\'s the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!||He\'s feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!||The Ferrari red lines and there\'s nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... my... suspenders... from... your.... side view mirror.\"||','1401219957000','2016-06-12 15:59:00',1,1,'wolfesluck'),(579,'t3_38zztm','How does an Apple Watch owner know that it\'s midday?','It\'s already run out of battery.||','1433745360000','2016-06-12 15:59:01',1,1,'ConsiderablyMediocre'),(580,'t3_2v6dtu','A pirate walks into bar and sits...','A pirate walks into bar and sits down.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas. \"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I\'ve had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I\'m not giving you a thing to eat, we\'re strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.

Next he calls over Safron: You have been a very naughty hippy, Safron. Taking drugs, sleeping with everyone, and worst of all you thoought peace and love was a load of shite....and he ushers her off to the highway to hell. Poor Moonchild sits on his cloud miserable and alone, and can\'t believe he\'ll spend eternity without his true love. One day Jesus is walking past his cloud and see\'s how truly sad Moonchild is. \'If you\'re a good hippy angel after a year and a day I will allow you to go down to hell to visit Safron...but be careful now; hell is a terrible place!\' Overjoyed Moonchild spends everyday practising the harp, polishing his cloud and focusing on his flying lessons. A year soon passes and Jesus leads him to the big escalator down to hell. \'Take care Moonchild and remember you only have 24 hours\'. As the escalator takes him down to the firey pits Moonchild scans the faces of the tormented until he see Safron waiting for him with a big smile on her face. The two lovers are happily reunited and Safron shows he lover around Hell. Casino\'s, nightclubs, free alcohol and drugs, free girls, no STD\'s, no hangovers, and endless money....Moonchild can\'t believe it. This is Hell? Safron even has her own strip club and the pair spend a wild night coked up and loved up - no shame, no guilt, no consequences. As dawn breaks Safron walks Moonchild back to the escalator and bids him a teary farewell and they promise to meet in a year and a day. When Moonchild gets back to heaven Jesus is there to meet him: How was it my son, was it difficult to witness such evil? Oh Yes, Jesus sir, such a bad, bad place. So aweful, says Moonchild hiding his smile. Well, says Jesus, off you go to harp lessons and say a hail Mary as you go......oh and by the way: Where is your harp? Moonchild suddenly realises the last time he saw it it was flattened under 6 dirty, fire-breathing whores last night.

I bet you really think you\'re hot stuff, don\'t you? Well, I\'m not ready for the chopping block yet. I\'ll bet I\'m still the better bird. And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there. We\'ll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself.\"||The young rooster was of a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy. \"You\'re on,\" said the young rooster. \"And since I know I\'m so great, I\'ll even give you a head start of half a lap. I\'ll still win easy!\"||So the two roosters went over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering around to watch. The race begun and all the hens started cheering the roosters on.||After the first lap, the old rooster was still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guy\'s lead had slipped a little but he was still hanging in there. Unfortunately the old rooster\'s lead continued to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he was just barely in front of the young rooster.||By now the farmer heard all the commotion. He ran into the house, took his shotgun, and ran out to the barnyard figuring a fox or something was after his chickens. When he got there, he saw the two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead.

It all started in his early childhood. Ya see, he was orphaned from a very young age, but he still had very vivid memories of his parents. Now, his parents were horrible people, they abused him, and most of all scoffed at his aspirations of becoming a train conductor. He had run away and took up residence in the local orphanage. There all he dreamed of was being a REAL train conductor. He told all the staff, and they all supported his dreams. Several years pass and one day the owner of the orphanage came up to him and says: \"I am friends with the conductor at the train station, he\'s an old man like me and he\'s going to be retiring soon. He wanted to finish out this year, but he has offered you the position of ticket collector, so you can see how he runs the show. Once he retires you would be the new train conductor.\"||Now at this point our guy is elated. His dreams are coming true! He agrees to take the ticket collector position and will start the following morning. He wakes up at the crack of dawn and sets off for the train station. Everything was going well, he collects tickets flawlessly for about 3 or 4 months. During the middle of his shift, he notices a woman that has a striking resemblance to his mother. His mother was not in the same ballpark as anyone who is considered attractive, and he assumes it\'s her immediately. His heart starts racing, and he walks straight up to her. He takes his ticket puncher and begins to beat her with it. Now I\'m not going to go into the gory details about how he\'s using this ticket puncher, but just know it is gruesome. There\'s blood everywhere, small circular patches of skin all over the floor and the seats. The passengers are mortified. He kills this woman, and the police arrest him, he pleads guilty, is sentenced to death, and is taken to prison.||He is scheduled to be executed in a week, and like any man would, is dreading it. He thinks about how he would have done things differently, and maybe controlled his emotions if he was put in this scenario again. The night before his execution is a really stormy night, and his spirits are as low as ever. The jail guard senses that he\'s down and thinks he can cheer him up a bit with his last meal. A slight smile appears across his face, and he asks for his favorite, chicken fried steak, with a side of fried okra. He eats everything on the plate and asks for more.||The method of execution during this time was the electric chair, and the operators were getting it set up for its next victim. The execution is going quite normally, or as normally as any execution can go, and our guy sits down in his chair. They put the hat on his head. Strap him down. Ask for any last words. Then begin to electrocute him. This execution is more spectacular than any other execution these men have ever seen before. There\'s smoke, violent thrashing, and worst of all screaming. After a minute or so they cut the power.||He\'s sitting in the chair very motionless. They begin to unstrap him and much to their surprise he sits up! Now his punishment was to be electrocuted by the electric chair, and he was in fact electrocuted in the electric chair. They can\'t punish the poor man again, so they release him hoping he\'s learned his lesson.||He picks up his job collecting tickets again and is told if he does anything wrong again, he\'s out of there. Once again several months pass, and as he is collecting tickets, he runs into a man who is reminiscent of his father. His mother was bad, but to him his father was worse. He doesn\'t even have the composure to walk over to him. He breaks out into a sprint down 3 train cars. He tackles the man and once again murders him (much more brutally than the last one). The same thing happens that happened to him last time. He is sent to court. Sentenced to death by the electric chair, and sent to prison. He asks for a last meal, which he is denied, and is sitting in the electric chair the next day.||This time the operators aren\'t fucking around. They douse this guy in water. Turn up the power to levels that are high enough to kill an elephant. They turn it on, and just as last time there is a shitload of thrashing, screaming smoke, and the smell of burning hair and flesh. They leave that sucker on for muccchhh too long for anyone to possibly survive it. They cut the power, and check to see if the man still lives. Much to their dismay he, although burned, hairless, and in a world of hurt, sits up. The lead operator loses his mind and gets in his face.||\"HOW! How are you still alive!? I understand that the first time it may have been a freak accident, but this time we were going to make SURE you were dead.\"||Our guy looks him straight in the eyes, and with a quiet, raspy voice, he says \"I guess I\'m just not a very good conductor\".||Now I\'m kinda new here and I don\'t know if this joke has been here before.

Benny was a simple man with simple talents and simple desires. He was a quiet fellow who loved to walk the beach when he had some time to spare. He was the kind of guy you wouldn\'t mind having a drink with, but anything more might be tedious. One day, as Benny was walking the beach, he stumbled over a small black jar-shaped object. Benny curiously picked it up and began to brush off the sand.||Woosh||Benny winced as sand flew into his eyes, blinding him temporarily. By the time he opened his eyes, a shadow had been cast over him.||\"I AM KHALROG, GENIE OF THE URN, YOU HAVE AWOKEN ME FROM MY SLUMBER. WHAT IS YOUR ONE TRUE DESIRE?\" the genie bellowed.||Stunned, Benny could hardly believe what he was seeing. Benny thought for a moment as he regained his senses. Then he began to speak, \"Well, I\'ve always wanted a magnificent beard. I\'ve always had a hard time with the ladies and I hear great beards are a wonderful attraction.\"||\"VERY WELL,\" replied the genie, \"YOU MAY HAVE YOUR BEARD. HOWEVER, I MUST WARN YOU THAT THIS BEARD COMES AT A PRICE: YOU MUST NEVER SHAVE IT OFF.\"||Benny thought for a moment, then agreed to the genie\'s conditions. A brilliant beard protruded from Benny\'s chin and grew and grew until finally it reached his belly. This was fantastic! Surely he would be a ladies\' man now!||Years passed by as Benny became an icon of beard lovers everywhere. He won contest after contest and seducing women had never been easier. Then one day, he met the woman of his dreams. They went on several dates together before she revealed to him that she would love nothing else than to see him without his beard. Benny loved his beard, but he loved this woman much more. Reluctantly, he agreed to shave it off in the morning.||The next morning, Benny grabbed his razor and started to shave his beard.||POOF||Suddenly, Benny was teleported into a round, black room!||\"Egad!\" Benny cried. \"Where am I!?\"||\"YOU HAVE DISOBEYED THE ONE RULE, BENNY,\" a voice behind him roared.||Benny stammered, \"But I...

They decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem. The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP, and third-parties selected. Six months (and $8 million) later they had a fantastic solution - on time, on budget, and high quality. Everyone in the project was pleased.||They solved the problem by using a high-tech precision scale that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighed less than it should. The line would stop, someone would walk over, remove the defective box, and then press another button to re-start the line. As a result of the new package monitoring process, no empty boxes were being shipped out of the factory.||With no more customer complaints, the CEO felt the $8 million was well spent. He then reviewed the line statistics report and discovered the number of empty boxes picked up by the scale in the first week was consistent with projections, however, the next three weeks were zero! The estimated rate should have been at least a dozen boxes a day. He had the engineers check the equipment, they verified the report as accurate.||Puzzled, the CEO traveled down to the factory, viewed the part of the line where the precision scale was installed, and observed just ahead of the new $8 million dollar solution sat a $20 desk fan blowing the empty boxes off the belt and into a bin.

As you\'d expect from an amateur golfer, the ball slices hard right and off the fairway, breaking a window in a nearby house. Slightly embarrassed, the man says to his wife, \"Well I feel bad. We\'d better go knock on their door and offer to pay to replace the window.\" So, they put their game on hold and walk over to the house.||The man knocks on the door and waits a few seconds before hearing a male voice simply say, \"Enter!\" The couple walks in to a large, well-decorated house and stop in the entryway. They still don\'t see anyone or hear anyone speak, so the man says loudly, \"Uhh... Hello?\" The same voice is then heard from another room within the house saying, \"Take a right, and then a left, and then another right. There, you\'ll find me.\"||Sure enough, the husband and wife follow the man\'s directions and find the source of the voice. There in the middle of a large area rug within a beautiful living room sits a man. He is cross-legged on the floor wearing nothing but linen pants and a large turban. As they approach the man, the couple notices the golf ball had not only broken a picture window, but had then hit a decorative vase, which lie broken on the floor.||\"My wife and I just came by so I could apologize for breaking your window and offer to pay to have it replaced,\" the man says, but is cut off. As the odd-looking man raises his hand and bows his head, he says, \"Do not fret. I am a genie, and I have been trapped inside this vase for 5,000 years. I am very grateful for having been released, so I will now grant you three wishes.\"||Excitedly, the couple looked at one another and the man quickly piped up, \"I could used about 20 million bucks!\" to which the genie replied, \"It is done. Take this slip of paper. On it is written your new account number.\"||Then, the woman says, \"I\'ve always wanted a chateau on river in Paris!\" So the genie replied, \"It is done. Take this slip of paper. On it is written the address to your new home.\"||Now, the two decided they should really think about their third wish. They began whispering off to the side about what they want it to be. Meanwhile, the genie asks, \"May I interject? I have been trapped inside that vase without the company of a woman for 5,000 years. I\'ve already granted you $20 million and a beautiful home in Paris. Would you possibly be open to allowing me 30 minutes in the bedroom with your lovely wife?\"||The couple talks about it briefly, and eventually the man says, \"Well I\'m getting a ton of money out of the deal, and my wife is getting her dream home, so we\'ve decided that would be okay.\"||So, the genie and the woman go into the other room and come out 30 minutes later. As the genie finds his place on the floor once again, the couple promptly returns to discussing their third wish. After another short period, the genie chimes in once again, saying, \"Excuse me, if I may interrupt just one more time. How old are you sir?\" The man, slightly confused, replies, \"That\'s a weird question for a time like this, but I\'m 29.\" Then the genie turns to the man\'s wife and asks, \"And you ma\'am, how old are you?\" Visibly puzzled, she says, \"That\'s hardly an appropriate question to ask a lady, but I\'m 27.\"||To this, the genie takes a moment to stand up from his seated position and says, \"Aren\'t you two a little old to believe in genies??\"||','1465589857000','2016-06-21 20:51:19',1,100,'megatron51'),(2543,'t3_4mhtwm','Two pilots are landing a plane.','Two pilots are preparing to land and they\'re coming in hot.

The town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. Everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. Yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. He worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. It was hard work, and Yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. Yuri\'s life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.||Every day, while Yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. The billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that Yuri had little interest in. Today, however, Yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. It read, \"SWIMMING LESSONS\" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. This ad had given Yuri something to be interested in. He had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. Yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 Rubles base fee.||Yuri was sad, because this was much more than Yuri could afford to spend. However, he thought to himself, \"If I could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, I should have enough...\" After this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. He even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. Finally, at the end of the month, Yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.||Every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. He had started quickly and advanced rapidly. Everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by Yuri\'s natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in Moscow. It was truly a passion of Yuri\'s.||A few months had passed, and Yuri\'s amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across Russia, considering a swimming prodigy. Yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. However, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. For him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.||Later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. While it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words \"DIVING PRACTICES\" in big letters. Diving was something that Yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. The pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for Yuri to practice diving. However, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. He looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. The base fee was 7500 Rubles.||Yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. The factory was beginning to offer less and less money to Yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. He had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. However, Yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.||The practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. He continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. Much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.||Many people had heard of Yuri at this point. Several news stories across Russia were focused around Yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. He continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. \"It is only something I am fond of, a hobby\" Yuri would say. \"I still have a life in the factory that I must attend to every day. It is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what I use to keep myself healthy.\" Despite his fame and popularity, Yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. Despite all of Yuri\'s hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.||For yet another time, Yuri was on his way to the factory. The billboard had changed once again. Yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. \"TRAVEL TO AMERICA TODAY!\" read the ad. Yuri was very interested. He had always heard of America, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. The land of the free! It was a very exciting idea to Yuri. However, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. Unfortunately, he thought correctly. The boats that traveled to America were advertised as costing 60,000 Rubles.||Yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. The factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. However, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. It truly was his passion, and Yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.||Finally, the year had passed, and Yuri had finally saved up enough Rubles to be able to ride the boat to America. He climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. The boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. The boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. About a day had passed when people had finally recognized Yuri, the famed Russian swimmer and diver. They were all very excited to meet Yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. \"It is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. It is something I use to endure the hardships and trials of my life...\" Yuri would always respond to his fans.||One day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat\'s gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. It was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. One of the passengers asked Yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. \"Hey, Yuri! While we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? I would LOVE to see them!\" Yuri was hesitant at first. Another passenger asked, \"And maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? The water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!\" Yuri replied, \"Well... ok, if you all insist I do it.\"||Yuri looked off the side of the boat. On the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. Yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured Yuri that he wouldn\'t hit it in a million years. Yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. With the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. His fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. As he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for Yuri to land smoothly in the water.||Unfortunately, Yuri never landed in the water. He landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat\'s balcony below. The impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. Yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. Many people were about to call for medics when Yuri managed to get up slowly. \"Are you alright Yuri? That fall looked hard! That must have broken some bones!\" Yuri, however, had barely an injury. As he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. This had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person\'s bones, if not killed them. Instead, Yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.||\"It is OK, everybody\" Yuri yelled back. \"I have endured many hardships in my life.\"||','1464055976000','2016-06-21 20:53:03',1,100,'plokmijnq'),(2710,'t3_4kjw47','A guy goes to the doctor','A guy goes to the doctor for his annual checkup, and the doctor says, \"You need to stop masturbating.\"||\"Why?\" the man asks.||The doctor replies, \"Because I\'m trying to examine you.\"||','1463943151000','2016-06-21 20:53:04',1,100,'_e_e_e_'),(2711,'t3_4ohrrk','Do you want me to stop or just slow down','A lawyer runs a stop sign and gets pulled over by a sheriff.

The horse gals in love with the song. Then, he explores more of Jimi Hendrix\'s discography and soon enough he\'s a full on Jimi Hendrix fan.||After some time of being a Hendrix fan, the horse is inspired to be a guitarist. He gets all the money he has and buys a low-end used Stratocaster.||He begins to learn how to play, and quickly enough, he knows how to play every Jimi Hendrix song. He can play every riff flawlessly.||Then the horse decides, \"This isn\'t enough\". He wants to start a band. He had heard about this chicken who is an absolute beast at bass. So he finds the chicken and he asks him to join him. The chicken, who has a deep passion for music, accepts gladly. The chicken begins to listen to Jimi Hendrix, and soon enough, he can play the bass of every song perfectly.||But the two needed more band members. There is an older cow on the farm who used to play drums. They ask him, \"Would you like to join our band?\" But the cow seemed sad. The cow said, \"I would love to, but I sold my drums some time ago.\" The horse and chicken decide to buy a drum set for the cow. After they presented him with the drum set, the cow jumped with joy. Nostalgia running through his veins, he gets on the drums and rips it. The rumors were true; the cow was a legendary drummer. Flattered by the horse and chicken\'s efforts, the cow couldn\'t help but join the band. The cow began to listen to Jimi Hendrix, and could play every one of his songs in no time.||Now they have three amazing musicians, but something was missing: vocals. None of them could sing. The chicken then remembers a pig from college who used to be in music class with him. After much searching, they found the pig\'s whereabouts; it was a farm only 10 miles north! They travel to the other farm and find the pig. He is working on the field in his farm. They ask him, \"We\'re starting a band, but none of us can sing. Would you like to join us?\" The pig looks at the ground under him, and then at his dirty hooves. He tells them, \"Since I was a boy, my dream had always been to have a career in music. How I ended up here, I don\'t know. I\'ll join, because a career in music is my dream. No matter the risks, I\'m on board.\" And so, the pig joined, and listened to Jimi Hendrix, and learned every lyric to every Jimi Hendrix song.||Thus started the beginning of the Barnyard Bros. At first, they were just a Jimi Hendrix cover band. They received a nice, modest following of fans. They could emulate the Jimi Hendrix Experience flawlessly. The resemblance was uncanny. They were started to get the ball rolling.||Then the horse, the one who started it all, said again, \"This isn\'t enough\". They decided that if they were going to be big, it had to be their own music they were playing. They started to write their own music, and eventually recorded their first studio album. And everyone loved it. Their fan base was growing faster then they could ever imagine. Their album has sold over a million copies. Number 1 on iTunes. Number 1 on Google Play. Number 1 played album on Spotify. They were everywhere. They were the most popular band in the world.||The horse\'s old farmer gets a call. It\'s from Jimmy Kimmel\'s manager. Kimmel wants them on the show. The farmer calls up the horse and tells him of this opportunity. The horse is ecstatic. He and his band get to be on TV! What the horse did not know is that his farmer is a huge Jimmy Kimmel fan. It\'s been his dream to attend the show, but he hasn\'t had the finances to do so. He asks the horse, \"Please, can you find it in your heart to take me?\" The horse loved his farmer very much. His farmer was the one who gave him his job. Had it not been for that job, he would have never got that guitar, never started a band, and never would have been in the position he was in. The horse then agrees to take the farmer to see Jimmy Kimmel, and decides to give a little more. An all expenses paid, week long trip to LA, so the farmer can enjoy the city after he goes to the show.||The horse flies to LA a week before the rest to finalize the deal. He meets with Kimmel and his manager and sings the deal. It\'s official; the Barnyard Bros will be on the Jimmy Kimmel show.||The rest of the band and the farmer get on their flight to LA. But tragedy strikes. An engine fails. The plane is losing stability, but can still fly. In a few minutes, the other engine begins failing. The plane begins to plummet. The plane nose dives into the ground and crashes. There are no survivors. Everyone, the chicken, the cow, the pig, and the farmer, gone.||The horse hears about the news, and begins to break down in tears. \"This is my fault.\" he said to himself. The horse blamed himself for their deaths because he had started this band. They wouldn\'t be on that plane if he hadn\'t had the stupid idea to get the band together and go on the Kimmel show. He cancelled his appointment to be on the Jimmy Kimmel Show, as the Barnyard Bros were no more.||The horse, seeing as his friends were no longer alive, decides that he doesn\'t deserve to live either.

The enthusiasm wasn\'t there, no cheerful smile or impish oafishness characterised his stagger, and the hint of gleefulness from his glory days had long passed with the tide of the years.||The cardinal of Notre Damn, increasingly aware of the lacklustre in the sounds peeling from the bell tower, one day decided to ascend the steps to speak with the hunchback.||\"Quasi, mate, you\'ve done a Stirling job for Paris and its people over the years. You\'re ridgy-didge in my books, but ya know, some of the other priests have noticed that the ol joi de vivre just doesn\'t seem to be there for you anymore. Have you ever thought of training up a young apprentice to take over the bell ringing gig?||Quasi looks up through his mangy locks to meet the cardinals eyes, first in anger, but then in resignation. He stares off into the distance, far across the reaches of the city skyline and mumbles quietly \"You know, I\'ve never really considered it. This place has been my home and my family for so long, I\'ve never wanted anything else. But maybe you\'re right. Maybe it\'s time to find something more, something different.... Give me a few days to mull it over.\"||After a long period of soul-searching and self-reflection, Quasi finally agrees to the cardinals idea and heads down out of his tower and once again into the bustling markets of les enfants rouge where he comes across a cheerful young man, shining shoes for pennies.||Quasi approaches the young man, raising his hood ever so slightly to reveal the prominence of his enormous brow, and with a twinkle in his eye, he says \"Hey kid, want a real job?\". The young man, instantly awestruck by the presence of the legend jumps to his feet and says \"it\'s, it\'s you... it\'s really you!\"||\"Shhhh!!\" says Quasi, \"what I\'m offering you is something only that only the most dedicated, the most fearless, and the most selfless of souls would dare accept.\"||\"Are you interested?\" \"Of course!\" \"Then follow me\"||A short while later, the two men stand atop the south tower in the full brunt of a cold and windy Parisian winters\' day. The young man shivers in the cold, the older man looks intently into his eyes.||\"This is where the magic happens kid\" he says, spreading his deformed arm expansively across the vista before their eyes. \"The only real challenge to the job is actually getting ol Emmanuel to sing. You see, unlike the other bells, this grand bell lost its clapper years ago and the cardinal has been pretty skimp on the upkeep of these towers. Over the last few years, I\'ve mastered my own technique. So pay attention boy, and watch how it\'s done.\"||The hunchback throws off his heavy cloak, revealing his aged and gnarled musculature, and with the wind whipping at his grey beard he roots each of his enormous arms to the lip of the bell, drawing it back with all his might and flinging it forward and up into the air. He releases and with the enormous bell waving slowly, silently, menacingly, back and forth, he turns back to the young man and growls \"Strength, courage and bravery. If you hesitate you will get hurt\".||He waits and watches the bell, and at the apogee, he sets his stance, raises his shoulders to his neck, grits his teeth, and leans in as the mass of metal rushes at his head.||A deep and resonant peel rings out as the crown of his forehead connects with the strike point, stopping the bell almost dead in its trajectory, save for a few inches of controlled sliding underfoot from the hunchback.||\"Your turn kid\"||Quasi draws the young man close and says \"I\'ll get it swinging, just concentrate on what I said. Courage, Strength, Bravey\" He\'s sets the bell into a gentle spin and let\'s the young man set himself for the challenge.||The young man leaps into face the bell, but at the last instant, he is overcome with terror and attempts to avert his face by flinching back, only to have the lip crash hard into his mandible, fracturing his jaw instantly and dislodging several teeth in the process. The bell lets out a muffled peel. The young man collapses to the floor, clutching his face.||\"No, no, no!!\" yells Quasi \"You lost your nerve! You can never flinch. If you have to back out, then for god\'s sake duck! Don\'t flinch back!\"||The young man slowly rises to his feet, clearly severely injured, but determined. Quasi raises one eyebrow and says \"Again?\" The boy nods.||Once more, the old man sets the bell in motion. Once more, the young man sets himself. Once more he flinches. This time raising his nose to meet the lip of the giant bell.||Crunch!||Once more, blood erupts from his face, and once more the young man crumples to the floor to the whimper of a soft peel of response from the bell.||Quasi looks at the young man and grumbles to himself \"I should have never agreed to this. Young kids these days... They don\'t listen and they\'ve got no bloody resilience\"||\"Look kid, just forget it. Go home, go back to shining shoes for pennies. I will find someone else who actually has real courage, real strength and real bravery.\"||Incensed, as Quasi had hoped, the young man staggers to his feet once more, and with a mangled primal scream into the harsh winter\'s wind, he grabs the bell, and fuelled with adrenaline and rage, casts it with near Herculean strength high up into the sky.||But rather than taking time to set himself, this time her reacts instantly and instinctually. He haunches his shoulders and aims his crown directly at the lip on the very first return of the bell. He makes perfect contact!||The bell peels deeply, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the change in momentum of the impact in against an unset stance sends the young man flying backwards through the air, straight out of the bell tower and down onto the cobbled streets below where he lands with a solid thud.||\"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!!\" mutters Quasi repeatedly as he hobbles down the steps to the tower as quickly as possible and out onto the street where a crowd have gathered.||A passer by is at the young mans side, cradling his lifeless head in his hands he looks up to the crowd and says \"Does anyone know this young mans name?!\"||Quasi looks down and says \"Shit, you know I never did get his name, but his face rings a bell.\"||','1466646482000','2016-06-23 19:07:57',1,100,'vandemonianish'),(3341,'t3_4pecae','What do you call a ship that drives itself?','Auto-pirate.||','1466646923000','2016-06-23 19:07:57',1,100,'Lambykinz'),(3342,'t3_4pgdr6','2 in 3 people live next to a pedophile','I don\'t, I live next door to two smoking hot 8 year olds.||','1466683499000','2016-06-23 19:07:59',1,100,'DR-Feel'),(3343,'t3_4permm','A Blonde wants to learn how to fly a plane...','A Blonde woman wants to learn how to fly a plane, so she goes to the flight school and asks one of the instructors to help her.||He looks at her and says \" All of our planes are taken right now, but we do have this helicopter you could learn to fly. \"||The blonde accepts and they go off to the helicopter.

After years of lobbying, he finally is awarded a contract to construct a perfectly-flat, perfectly-straight 16-lanes-each-direction highway from Los Angeles to Washington. So he employs all the best surveyors, to make sure the highway is a perfect straight-line from LA to DC and to make sure it stays perfectly flat. He subcontracts with only the best construction crews and uses only the best materials. He decides the existing tunnel-diggers and mountain removers just aren\'t up to the job, so he has bigger ones built, ones that can remove a half-mile swath of the Rockies in a week. They start in LA, and a few months later, they\'re overlooking the greater Washington metropolis. Just one more hill to remove before they start work on the terminus and the merging into DC\'s outer belts. It\'s a small hill, really, but it\'s got to go. So they call in one of the smaller mountain-removers to remove it, and just as the machine\'s getting ready to erase the hill, a snake pops up out of the hill and screams \"Wait!\" Obviously, this catches everyone by surprise, so they wait. The snake continues, \"My name\'s Nate. Nate the Snake. You can\'t destroy this hill! You mustn\'t!\" \"Why not?\" \"Because there\'s a lever buried under this hill, and it\'s attached to a doomsday device. If the lever is tripped, it\'ll blow up the entire Earth!\" The engineer consults with his team. \"What do you think?\" \"It\'s a talking snake.\" \"Yeah, but do we believe him? Do we go around the hill, or do we plow it over?\" \"Do we believe him!? It\'s a talking snake! Who\'d believe us?\" In the end, they decide to err on the side of caution and build the highway around the hill. So, when they\'re finished, they\'ve got a highway running from LA to DC that\'s perfectly-flat and perfectly-straight, except for this minor detour around a hill. So they\'ve got the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and as a perk for designing and building the highway, the engineer gets to be the very first person to use it. So he hops into his Lamborghini in LA at dawn and floors the pedal. 30, 40, 50mph. Shifts into 2nd gear. 70, 90, 110mph. He keeps accelerating until the car just can\'t go any faster. Shortly before sunset, he\'s approaching DC, and he remembers the hill. So he slows down to around 225mph to negotiate the slight turn. And he sees Nate crossing the road! He can\'t squish a talking snake! Especially one that kept them from blowing up the Earth. So he swerves to avoid hitting Nate, and plows into the hill at over 200mph. He trips the lever, and the Earth blows up. The moral of the story... Better Nate than lever.||Credit: Jose Rojas||','1466663682000','2016-06-23 19:10:13',1,100,'JyoungPNG'),(3530,'t3_4pf0nk','What happened when the electrical engineer found out she hadn\'t won the lottery?','She soldered on.||','1466657364000','2016-06-23 19:10:13',1,100,'eeedubbb'),(3531,'t3_4pey5g','I love being the biggest guy in the gym','I just hate how empty it is.||','1466656149000','2016-06-23 19:10:14',1,100,'newUsername2'),(3532,'t3_4peue9','A woman applies for a job.','And she doesn\'t get the job.

It\'s a long joke but funny to tell people.','There is an anthill in a backyard. Out in the direct sunlight where sunlight is shining on it all day. It was a small anthill so the owners of the house didn\'t pay much attention to it.Another much larger anthill was under a tree not far from this anthill. The trees shade kept this anthill cool all day as it was always under its shadow. One day a young girl gets too close to it while playing and is bitten by a few ants. The dad decides the large anthill must go so he decides to call an exterminator the next day.||Back at the anthill three mean looking ants are being scolded by their queen for biting the little girl. Her squire tries to defend them by saying,\" she was in our territory. She deserved to be attacked.\" The queen tells the squire to shut his mouth and she sends the three ants to the dungeon which angers the squire.||The next day the squire sets out early that morning to find something to poison the queen because he is tired of her arrogance and he thinks she\'s not a good leader. The queen decides to have a big ceremony that day with every ant from the anthill present for a big announcement she has to make.||She plans to expand the anthill out into the sunlight so that they are not always covered by the trees shadow. Before the meeting starts one of her loyal subjects tells her that the squire is not there but she says she will go on without him after the way he acted the day before.||During the ceremony the exterminator comes and kills every ant in the large anthill with poison and knocks the hill down flat.||After a while the squire comes back to find his home destroyed and all the ants he has ever known dead. The squire does not frown tho because he is happy as long as the queen is dead.||He makes his way up the tree and in the distance he spots a small mound of dirt similar to an anthill in the open sunlight and he decides he will head towards it even though he had never been out in the sunlight his entire life.||Meanwhile at the anthill out in the sunlight they are all enjoying their wonderful lives and slowly each day working to build their anthill up.||Eventually the squire makes his way up to other anthill and is greeted by the other ants. He tells them, \" I went out to collect food for my lovely queen and when I came back everyone was dead and the anthill was crushed.\" The other ants take him to the queen and he tells her his story.||She gives the squire a room to stay in and tells him that he can be her new squire. He still feels angry that he did not get to kill the other queen so he begins to plot. Days go by and the queen has many meetings with her loyal subjects, but the squire does not show up to many of these meetings.||She tells her fellow ants to keep their eyes out for the squire and keep her informed of his daily actions because she believes he may be up to something. More days go buy and the queen is scheduled to have a huge dinner with every ant in the anthill. The squire actually shows up to this dinner but he is not chatting or being sociable with any of the other ants.||About halfway through the event a chef is found dead after tasting the meal that was being prepared for the queen. The guards rush to the squire and arrest him. He denies it all at first but after three days in jail he finally confesses.

The enthusiasm wasn\'t there, no cheerful smile or impish oafishness characterised his stagger, and the hint of gleefulness from his glory days had long passed with the tide of the years.||The cardinal of Notre Damn, increasingly aware of the lacklustre in the sounds peeling from the bell tower, one day decided to ascend the steps to speak with the hunchback.||\"Quasi, mate, you\'ve done a Stirling job for Paris and its people over the years. You\'re ridgy-didge in my books, but ya know, some of the other priests have noticed that the ol joi de vivre just doesn\'t seem to be there for you anymore. Have you ever thought of training up a young apprentice to take over the bell ringing gig?||Quasi looks up through his mangy locks to meet the cardinals eyes, first in anger, but then in resignation. He stares off into the distance, far across the reaches of the city skyline and mumbles quietly \"You know, I\'ve never really considered it. This place has been my home and my family for so long, I\'ve never wanted anything else. But maybe you\'re right. Maybe it\'s time to find something more, something different.... Give me a few days to mull it over.\"||After a long period of soul-searching and self-reflection, Quasi finally agrees to the cardinals idea and heads down out of his tower and once again into the bustling markets of les enfants rouge where he comes across a cheerful young man, shining shoes for pennies.||Quasi approaches the young man, raising his hood ever so slightly to reveal the prominence of his enormous brow, and with a twinkle in his eye, he says \"Hey kid, want a real job?\". The young man, instantly awestruck by the presence of the legend jumps to his feet and says \"it\'s, it\'s you... it\'s really you!\"||\"Shhhh!!\" says Quasi, \"what I\'m offering you is something only that only the most dedicated, the most fearless, and the most selfless of souls would dare accept.\"||\"Are you interested?\" \"Of course!\" \"Then follow me\"||A short while later, the two men stand atop the south tower in the full brunt of a cold and windy Parisian winters\' day. The young man shivers in the cold, the older man looks intently into his eyes.||\"This is where the magic happens kid\" he says, spreading his deformed arm expansively across the vista before their eyes. \"The only real challenge to the job is actually getting ol Emmanuel to sing. You see, unlike the other bells, this grand bell lost its clapper years ago and the cardinal has been pretty skimp on the upkeep of these towers. Over the last few years, I\'ve mastered my own technique. So pay attention boy, and watch how it\'s done.\"||The hunchback throws off his heavy cloak, revealing his aged and gnarled musculature, and with the wind whipping at his grey beard he roots each of his enormous arms to the lip of the bell, drawing it back with all his might and flinging it forward and up into the air. He releases and with the enormous bell waving slowly, silently, menacingly, back and forth, he turns back to the young man and growls \"Strength, courage and bravery. If you hesitate you will get hurt\".||He waits and watches the bell, and at the apogee, he sets his stance, raises his shoulders to his neck, grits his teeth, and leans in as the mass of metal rushes at his head.||A deep and resonant peel rings out as the crown of his forehead connects with the strike point, stopping the bell almost dead in its trajectory, save for a few inches of controlled sliding underfoot from the hunchback.||\"Your turn kid\"||Quasi draws the young man close and says \"I\'ll get it swinging, just concentrate on what I said. Courage, Strength, Bravey\" He\'s sets the bell into a gentle spin and let\'s the young man set himself for the challenge.||The young man leaps into face the bell, but at the last instant, he is overcome with terror and attempts to avert his face by flinching back, only to have the lip crash hard into his mandible, fracturing his jaw instantly and dislodging several teeth in the process. The bell lets out a muffled peel. The young man collapses to the floor, clutching his face.||\"No, no, no!!\" yells Quasi \"You lost your nerve! You can never flinch. If you have to back out, then for god\'s sake duck! Don\'t flinch back!\"||The young man slowly rises to his feet, clearly severely injured, but determined. Quasi raises one eyebrow and says \"Again?\" The boy nods.||Once more, the old man sets the bell in motion. Once more, the young man sets himself. Once more he flinches. This time raising his nose to meet the lip of the giant bell.||Crunch!||Once more, blood erupts from his face, and once more the young man crumples to the floor to the whimper of a soft peel of response from the bell.||Quasi looks at the young man and grumbles to himself \"I should have never agreed to this. Young kids these days... They don\'t listen and they\'ve got no bloody resilience\"||\"Look kid, just forget it. Go home, go back to shining shoes for pennies. I will find someone else who actually has real courage, real strength and real bravery.\"||Incensed, as Quasi had hoped, the young man staggers to his feet once more, and with a mangled primal scream into the harsh winter\'s wind, he grabs the bell, and fuelled with adrenaline and rage, casts it with near Herculean strength high up into the sky.||But rather than taking time to set himself, this time he reacts instantly and instinctually. He haunches his shoulders and aims his crown directly at the lip on the very first return of the bell. He makes perfect contact!||The bell peels deeply, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the change in momentum of the impact in against an unset stance sends the young man flying backwards through the air, straight out of the bell tower and down onto the cobbled streets below where he lands with a solid thud.||\"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!!\" mutters Quasi repeatedly as he hobbles down the steps to the tower as quickly as possible and out onto the street where a crowd have gathered.||A passer by is at the young mans side, cradling his lifeless head in his hands he looks up to the crowd and says \"Does anyone know this young mans name?!\"||Quasi looks down and says \"Shit, you know I never did get his name. I murdered a boy and never even knew his name!\"||Distraught, Quadimodo committed suicide, jumping off the bell tower to his death.||','1466664041000','2016-06-23 19:10:58',1,100,'C3Sabertooth'),(3603,'t3_4pf0mz','KNOCK KNOCK!','The person who made up knock-knock jokes should get a Nobel award.||','1466657355000','2016-06-23 19:10:58',1,100,'ug_kid'),(3604,'t3_4pey3c','What is a pirates favorite letter?','No, it\'s the C.||','1466656120000','2016-06-23 19:10:58',1,100,'GandalfSwagOff'),(3605,'t3_4pegxa','Two drums and a cymbal fall off a cliff...','Ba-dum tssh!||','1466648789000','2016-06-23 19:10:59',1,100,'madazzahatter'),(3606,'t3_4pe8mb','My thoughts on camping...','In-tents||','1466645487000','2016-06-23 19:11:00',1,100,'Gradedcoder'),(3607,'t3_4pe57i','What do you call a group of birds that are robotic and remotely controlled?','A Squa-drone||','1466644223000','2016-06-23 19:11:00',1,100,'Shebloong'),(3608,'t3_4pe0m8','What kind of bees make milk?','Boobies||','1466642459000','2016-06-23 19:11:01',1,100,'Magentapeonie'),(3609,'t3_4pjkip','Where does an Italian thug live?','In the speggetto||','1466722478000','2016-06-23 19:11:01',1,100,'Multastic'),(3610,'t3_4pjizi','What\'s the best way to reward a fat waitress?','Cow tipping.||','1466721931000','2016-06-23 19:11:02',1,100,'Ivan_Whackinov'),(3611,'t3_4pjih8','How to Stop a Bullet','When the bullet is coming towards you, grab a towel.
